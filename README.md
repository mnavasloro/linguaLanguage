# linguaLanguage
Auxiliary Java project to add a new Language to [Lingua](https://github.com/pemistahl/lingua).

Need to add a "lib" folder in the root and put there the ```lingua-with-dependencies.jar```` file built after adding the new language information. My version adding Galician can be downloaded from [here](https://delicias.dia.fi.upm.es/nextcloud/index.php/s/2mko47jaH6rxgJs) (it is bigger than the 100MB Github limit).
